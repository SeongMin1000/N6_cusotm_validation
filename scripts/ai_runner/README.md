# AiRunner

## Overview

`stm_ai_runner` is a Python module providing an unified inference interface
for the different X-CUBE-AI runtime: X86 or STM32. It allows to use the
generated c-model from an user Python script like a `tf.lite.Interpreter` to
perform an inference. According the capabilities of the associated run-time,
profiling data are also reported (execution time per layer,...).
For advanced usage, the user has the possibility to register a callback allowing
to have the intermediate tensor/feature
values before and/or after the execution of a node.

## Requirements

see `requirements.txt` file.

    pip install -r requirements.txt


Set the environment variable `PYTHONPATH` to tell python where to find the
module.

    $ export PYTHONPATH=<path/to/ai_runner>:$PYTHONPATH


## Getting started

### With a X86 shared library

With the stm.ai 6.0 CLI, `validate` command is used to generate the X86 shared library
(or DLL in Windows world), default location: `stm32ai_ws/inspector_network/workspace/lib/libai_network.dll`

    $ stm32ai validate <my_model> --split-weights

**Note:** `--split-weights` is currently a workaround to generate the shared library with
the weights.
      
With X-CUBE-AI v7+, `--dll` must be used with the `generate` command:
      
    $ stm32ai generate <my_model> --dll


The `example\minimal.py` script is a minimal example to open the shared library
and to perform an inference with the random data. Full file path of the shared
library can be passed to the `connect()` method or only a root directory.

```Python
from stm_ai_runner import AiRunner
runner = AiRunner()
runner.connect('file:stm32ai_ws')  # 'file' prefix can be omitted
...
outputs, _ = runner.invoke(inputs)  # invoke the model
...
```

    $ python examples\minimal.py -d file:stm32ai_ws


### With a STM32 aiValidation firmware

Same interface can be used also to inject the data and to retrieve the predictions from a
model running on a STM32 board. Firmware should be generated with the aiValidation test
application to have the COM stack with the HOST.

```Python
from stm_ai_runner import AiRunner
runner = AiRunner()
runner.connect('serial')  # default, auto-detection
...
outputs, _ = runner.invoke(inputs)  # invoke the model
...
```

    $ python examples\minimal.py -d serial


### Evaluating a generated TFLite model

The `examples/tflite_test.py` script is a typical example to compare the outputs of the
generated C-model against the predictions from the `tf.lite.Interpreter`.

```Python
outputs, _ = ai_runner.invoke(inputs)
tf_outputs = tf_run(tf_interpreter, inputs)
```

1. Generate the X86 shared library or/and the STM32 aiValidation firmware with the TFLite model  
2. Compare the outputs with a STM32 run-time

```bash
$ python examples/tflite_test.py -m <tflite_file_path> -d serial
```


### Per-layer or per-layer-with-data capabilities

The `examples/ai_runner_test.py` script provides an example to exploite the contents
of the returned `profiler` dictionary.  

```python
outputs, profiler = session.invoke(inputs, mode=mode)
```


## Profiler

The `ìnvoke()` method returns a list of numpy (`outputs`) with the predictions and
a dictionary (`profiler`) with the profiling/stat information.
