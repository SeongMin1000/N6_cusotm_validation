title:  MNIST example
---


# Overview

This is a typical example to use the ST AI runner Python module with the user data against
the generated c-model to perform a advanced validation flow.

`'train.py'` allows to generate and train a Keras model with the MNIST data set. The model
is also quantized using TFLite converter with a part of the data-set.

`'test.py'` demonstrates how to test the generate c-model (X86 or target implementation)
with the MNIST test data set. Classification report is based on sklearn.metrics function.


# Setting up work environment

Following Python packages should be installed in your Python 3.x environment to launch the scripts
(see `requirements.txt`file). It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

```
# to use ai_runner
protobuf<3.21
tqdm
colorama
pyserial

# for train/test scripts
tensorflow==2.15.1
scikit-learn
```

To use the `'test.py'` script, and be able to import the `'stm_ai_runner'` package,
the `'PYTHONPATH'` environment variable should updated:

```bash
export STEDGEAI_INSTALL_DIR=...  # root location where the stedgeai package has been installed
export PYTHONPATH=$STEDGEAI_INSTALL_DIR/scripts/ai_runner:$PYTHONPATH
```


## Note about the version of the 'protobuf' package

The `stm_ai_runner` package communicates with the board using a protocol based on the `'Nanopb'` module version 0.3.x. `'Nanopb'` is a plain-C implementation of Google's Protocol Buffers data format. The `stm_ai_runner` package is fully compatible with protobuf versions below 3.21. For more information, you can visit the [Nanopb website][NANO_PB]. If a more recent version of `'protobuf'` is installed in your environment and the protobuf package cannot be downgraded, the following environment variable can be used:

```bash
export PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python
```

# How-to

- Create and train the Keras model

```bash
python train.py
```

Generated model files: `mnist_fp32.h5`, `mnist_q_with_fp32_io.tflite`


- Generate and validate the c-model with ST AI CLI

Standard approach with random data based on the numerical comparaison between the execution of the
original model and the generated c-model. 

```bash
stedgeai validate -m mnist_q_with_fp32_io.tflite --target stm32
```

- Generate the shared lib (also called DLL) with the c-model

Following command allows to generate a shared library (including the 
generated network.c files and requested c-kernels) which should be
loaded in a Python process throught the ai_runner interface. 

```bash
stedgeai generate -m mnist_q_with_fp32_io.tflite --target stm32 --dll
```

```bash
 Generated files (6)
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 ...
 ..\st_ai_ws\inspector_network\workspace\lib\libai_network.dll

```

To perform also a validation on the board, a STM32 board should be also flashed with
the aiValidation test application including the model.


- Report the accuracy of the generated c-model and the MNIST test set

With the host shared library

```bash
python test.py -d st_ai_ws
```

```bash

With a STM32 board (first valid serial COM port is used)

```bash
python test.py -d serial
```

To indicate a specific serial COM port, following command can be used:

```bash
python test.py -d serial:COMx             # Windows world
python test.py -d serial:/dev/ttyACMx     # Linux/MacOS world
```
